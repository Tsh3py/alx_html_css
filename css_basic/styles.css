/* 1. Both container tags, <body> and <main> must be told that they are containers to flexible boxes */

/* 2. <body> contains a column of three boxes (<header>, <main> and <footer>) */

/* 3. Ensure the <main> tag keeps an automatic height and width */

    /* In a real project, height would be determined by content or responsive design. */
