# Headphones Project

This project involves building a fully functional and responsive static webpage from scratch, based on a provided Figma design. The goal is to apply HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design knowledge to achieve a pixel-perfect replication of the design without using any external CSS frameworks or JavaScript.

 ## Project Overview

The "Headphones Project" is a static webpage designed by Nicolas Philippot. It showcases a modern layout for a headphones product/service, featuring a hero section, "What we do" section, "Our results" section, and a "Contact us" section, culminating in a footer. The primary challenge is to accurately translate the visual design from Figma into functional HTML and CSS.

## Features

-   **Pixel-Perfect Design:** Aims to match the Figma design exactly.
-   **Fully Responsive:** Adapts to various screen sizes, including a dedicated mobile layout below 480px.
-   **Interactive Elements:** Hover/active states for links and buttons.
-   **Clean HTML & CSS:** Semantic HTML structure and maintainable CSS.
-   **Accessibility Focus:** Designed with accessibility best practices in mind (e.g., semantic tags, alt text).

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For structuring the webpage content.
-   **CSS3:** For styling the webpage, including advanced layout techniques like Flexbox.
-   **Figma:** Used as the design blueprint for implementation.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/alx_html_css.git](https://github.com/Tsh3py/alx_html_css.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd alx_html_css/headphones
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Interact with the webpage by resizing the browser window to see its responsiveness. Hover over links and buttons to observe their interactive states.

## Responsive Design

The webpage is designed to be fully responsive. It transitions to a mobile-optimized layout when the screen width is 480px or less, ensuring a great user experience across devices.

## Accessibility

Key accessibility considerations implemented include:
-   Use of semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.) for clear document structure.
-   Descriptive `alt` attributes for all images.
-   Clear focus states for interactive elements (inherent with native HTML elements).
-   Sufficient contrast ratios as per the Figma design.
